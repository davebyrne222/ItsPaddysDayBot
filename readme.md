# ItsPaddysDayBot
A simple bot to check reddit posts and comments for miss-spellings of St. Paddys day

# To do:
- [ ] CRITICAL: ensure blacklisted subs are not searched / responded to
- [ ] Ignore automod messages
- [ ] Use https://github.com/acini/praw-antiabuse-functions
- [ ] Improve searching method for 'Patty' (regex?)
- [ ] Change to use praw streams (i.e. implement multithreading for continuous monitoring of messages and subreddits)
- [ ] Implement postgres for storage (& use pydantic?)
